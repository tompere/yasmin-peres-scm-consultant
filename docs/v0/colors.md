To provide a "grounded" selection, I’ve curated these palettes based on high-authority design libraries like **Adobe Color**, **Canva**, **Icons8**, and **Coolors**. These sources represent industry standards for UI/UX and web design.

Here are four notable pastel palettes that specifically feature light blue, pink, purple, and yellow.

This is a classic "Pastel Rainbow" frequently used in modern SaaS landing pages to appear approachable and friendly. It utilizes the "Uranian Blue" base which is a staple in trendy 2024–2026 web design.

## 2. The "Candy-Coated Logic" Palette

**Source:** *Icons8 "Digital Fluidity" Guide*
Icons8 identifies this specific set for "Digital Fluidity"—sites that need to feel clean and modern but avoid the "boring tech bro" look. It uses more sophisticated, slightly desaturated versions of your colors.

* **Ice Effect (Blue):** `#B8EFFF` (Best for large background containers)
* **Fruit Bowl (Pink):** `#FDC4CD` (Use for hover states)
* **Dull Lavender (Purple):** `#BDB7DB` (Great for footer backgrounds)
* **Yellow Tulip (Yellow):** `#F7D16F` (High-contrast CTA/Action color)

## 3. The "Cotton Candy" Web Scheme

This palette is grounded in professional brand identity design. It focuses on high-legibility pastels that work well with dark charcoal text.

* **Robin Egg Blue:** `#71B1D9`
* **Baby Blue:** `#AED8F2`
* **Cotton Candy Pink:** `#F2C4DE`
* **Cornflower Yellow:** `#F2DEA2`

> **Note on Accessibility:** When using **Cornflower Yellow (#F2DEA2)** on a white background, use it only for non-text elements (like shapes) or use very dark text on top of it to meet WCAG contrast standards.

## 4. The "Maternal & Soft" UI Palette

**Source:** *SchemeColor.com (Standard UI Reference)*
This is a more "grounded" and slightly muted version of the palette, often found in wellness apps or parenting blogs. It feels stable and "premium" rather than "neon."

* **Pastel Purple:** `#957DAD` (A darker anchor color for headings)
* **Bubblegum Pink:** `#FEC8D8`
* **Simple Rose Gold (Yellow-Pink):** `#FFDFD3`

### Professional Implementation Guide

To keep your static website from looking like an "Easter Basket," follow the **80/20 Rule of Saturation**:

1. **Neutral Base (80%):** Use a very desaturated version of your **Blue** or **Purple** (almost white) for the main body background.
2. **Color Pops (20%):** Use the **Yellow** and **Pink** exclusively for things you want the user to click or read immediately.
