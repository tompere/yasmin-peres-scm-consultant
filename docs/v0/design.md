# Integrated Design Brief: Supply Chain Consultant One-Pager

## 1. Project Identity & Strategic Goal

* **Objective:** Transition a corporate pedigree into a high-authority solo consulting practice.
* **The "North Star":** The site must feel **"Premium & Precise."** In supply chain, errors are expensive; the design must reflect a "zero-defect" mentality through perfect alignment, ample whitespace, and mathematical harmony.
* **Language:** Hebrew (**RTL**).
* **Tech Stack:** Astro + Tailwind (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant).

---

## 2. Visual Direction (The "Blue-Chip" Aesthetic)

* **Design Language:** Move away from literal "trucks and boxes." Use **Abstract Connectivity**. Think of nodes, data flow, and network grids.
* **Color Theory:** * **Primary:** Deep Navy (#0A192F) – Represents stability and corporate "gravity."
* **Secondary/Accent:** Precision Teal or Muted Gold – Used strictly for **CTAs** and **Success Metrics**.


* **Typography:** High-legibility Sans-Serif (e.g., *Assistant* or *Heebo*). Use a clear typographic scale where H1 and H2 headers are significantly weighted to establish a hierarchy.

## 3. The Grounded Layout Outline (The Narrative Flow)

### Section 1: The Hero (Trust & Immediacy)

* **Layout:** **Asymmetrical Split-Screen (RTL).** * **Right Side (Text):** H1 Headline (The Hook) + Sub-headline (The Mechanism) + Primary CTA Button.
* **Left Side (Visual):** High-resolution professional headshot of the consultant.
* **UX Grounding:** Based on **NN/g** research, the eye should land on the consultant's face to build "Warmth" and then move immediately to the value proposition on the right.

### Section 2: The Trust Bar (Social Proof)

* **Layout:** Grayscale logo strip.
* **Content:** Previous employers, APICS/CSCP certifications.
* **UX Grounding:** This acts as a "Cognitive Shortcut," using known brands to validate your unknown brand.

### Section 3: Overview & Pain Points (The "F-Pattern" Scan)

* **Layout:** Three distinct cards highlighting industry challenges (e.g., Cost, Resiliency, Visibility).
* **Visual:** Minimalist line icons for each card.
* **UX Grounding:** Uses the **F-shaped scanning pattern** to let users identify their problems within seconds.

### Section 4: Services (Progressive Disclosure)

* **Layout:** A 2x3 or 3x3 Grid of Service Cards.
* **Interaction:** Each card features a "Brief Summary." Clicking "Learn More" expands an accordion or reveals a subtle overlay with technical depth.
* **UX Grounding:** Prevents "Cognitive Overload" by hiding complex details until the user expresses interest.

### Section 5: Methodology (The "Proprietary System")

* **Visual:** A horizontal or vertical **Chevron Process Diagram** (1. Discovery → 2. Analysis → 3. Strategy → 4. Execution).
* **Design Note:** This must look like a "Productized Service" to justify premium consulting fees.

### Section 6: About Me (The "Human" Element)

* **Layout:** 60/40 Split.
* **Content:** A more approachable narrative. This is where you bridge the "Corporate Expert" with the "Accessible Partner."
* **UX Grounding:** Placing this *after* services ensures you have solved their problem before you introduce yourself.

### Section 7: Lead Magnet & Contact (The Single-Column Rule)

* **Layout:** **Single-Column Vertical Form.**
* **Content:** Downloadable "2026 Risk Checklist" + Contact Form.
* **Fields:** Name, Email, Industry, and "Biggest Challenge."
* **UX Grounding:** Single-column forms have a **15% higher completion rate** than multi-column layouts due to a simpler vertical eye path.
